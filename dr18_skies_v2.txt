Summary
-------

This table stores the positions used as blank sky regions for DR18 targetting. The sky regions are selected by dividing the sky in tiles of HEALpix nside 32. Each tile is then subdivided in candidate regions of HEALpix nside 32768 and the pixels that meet the isolation requirements are considered valid skies. This process is repeated for a number of all-sky catalogues. See <a href="https://sdss.org/dr18/targeting/fps/"> for further details on skies target selection.


Columns
-------

pix_32768 - The HEALpix pixel (nside=32768) of the sky region.
ra - The RA of the centre of the sky pixel.
dec - The declination of the centre of the sky pixel.
down_pix - The HEALpix pixel (nside=256) of the sky region. Used internally to downsample the list of candidate region.
tile_32 -The HEALpix pixel (nside=32) of the sky region.
valid_gaia - Whether this is a valid sky region in the Gaia catalogue.
selected_gaia - Whether this sky region was selected in the Gaia catalogue.
sep_neighbour_gaia - Separation to the nearest neighbour [arcsec]
mag_neighbour_gaia - Magnitude of the nearest neighbour (G band).
valid_ls8 - Whether this is a valid sky region in the Legacy Survey DR18 catalogue.
selected_ls8 - Whether this sky region was selected in the Legacy Survey DR18 catalogue.
sep_neighbour_ls8 - Separation to the nearest neighbour [arcsec]
mag_neighbour_ls8 - Magnitude of the nearest neighbour (r-band).

valid_tycho2 - Whether this is a valid sky region in the Tycho2 catalogue.
selected_tycho2 - Whether this sky region was selected in the Tycho2 catalogue.
sep_neighbour_tycho2 - Separation to the nearest neighbour [arcsec]
mag_neighbour_tycho2 - Magnitude of the nearest neighbour (Vt band).
valid_tmass_xsc - Whether this is a valid sky region in the 2MASS extended source catalogue.
selected_tmass_xsc - Whether this sky region was selected in the 2MASS extended source catalogue.
sep_neighbour_tmass_xsc - Separation to the nearest neighbour [arcsec]
